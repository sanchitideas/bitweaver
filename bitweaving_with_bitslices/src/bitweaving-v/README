1. Please use the python scripts to create coded files for each column.

2. Then please use create_bitslices.cc to convert those files into the 
BitWeaving/V storage format with bit-group size 1 (which are just like bit-slices, 
but are cleverly loaded into memory to minimize cache-contention).

3. Then please use bitweaving_v_test.cc to specify the filenames & conditions 
to check by creating a BitWeaver object.

4. Please compile your code by running make.
Subsequently, if your computer has multiple sockets,
please use numactl to run the executable by binding it to memory 
modules physically attached to one of the sockets.
For example, use numactl --membind=1 <executable-name>
